RL agent (DQN)

DQN Agent for Lunar Lander
This project implements the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm using a Replay Buffer and soft target network updates to train an agent in the Lunar Lander environment from the OpenAI Gym library. 
The agent learns to control a lunar module to successfully land on the surface while minimizing fuel consumption and avoiding crashes.

Key Features of the Project:
DQN Algorithm:

Utilizes a neural network to approximate the Q-function.
Incorporates a Replay Buffer to improve training stability.
Implements soft target network updates for smooth parameter adjustments.
Training in the Lunar Lander Environment:

Training is conducted over 1000 episodes.
Employs an adaptive action-selection strategy using the Îµ-greedy approach.
Results Visualization:

This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning techniques like DQN can be applied to complex control tasks in simulated environments.
